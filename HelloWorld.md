# ReactJS Tutorial - 2 - Hello World


## Create React App

1. ```npm install -g create-react-app```
1. ```npx create-react-app hello-world ```
1. ```cd hello-world```
    >**NOTE :** If your project is built with **Create React App** run: ```npm run build```
  This will create a production build of your app in the ```build/``` folder of your project.

    Remember that this is only necessary before deploying to production. For normal development, use ```npm start```.
1. ```yarn start``` or  ```npm start```
1. Edit ```src/App.js``` and save to **reload**
    change this :

    ```html
        <p>
          Edit <code>src/App.js</code> and save to reload.
        </p>
    ```
    To
    ```html
        <p>
          Hello world
        </p>
    ```

Thats its Folks!
